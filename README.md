CMP237 Practicum problems for Exam No. 2

I did #1, 2, 3 for 16 points plus 8 extra points

1.) Added another else if statement that replaced the number with "zillions of". Runs with d8.

2.) Changed the "d+" to a "d{2}". Runs with node.

3.) Moved the number matches to properly fit the correct date. Runs with d8. This problem was for the extra points.
